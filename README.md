## Integration with Job Search Ecosystem

This project is designed to complement the existing job search automation tools:

### Data Flow
1. **startups-job-scraper**: Discovers and collects startup job opportunities
2. **job-search-api**: Processes and standardizes job data
3. **ai-job-scoring**: Analyzes and scores startup opportunities
4. **booking-agent-ts**: Provides web interface for startup job management

### API Integration
```python
# Planned integration with job-search-api
from job_search_api import JobProcessor

# Process startup jobs
processor = JobProcessor()
startup_jobs = processor.process_startup_jobs(collected_data)
```
